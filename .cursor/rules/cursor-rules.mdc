# Cursor Rules Location

How to add new cursor rules to the project

1. **ALWAYS** place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/*:
    ```
    .cursor/rules/
    ├── your-rule-name.mdc
    └── another-rule.mdc
    ```

2. Follow the conventions:
    - Use kebab-case for filenames
    - Always use .mdc extension
    - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose
    - Small, never bigger than 500 lines
    - Concise and easy to understand
    - Rules should be written like technical documentation explaining everything step by step with similar content being groupped
    - Rules should be composable, meaning, if a given topic is mentioned in more than one rule, the common topic should be extracted into its own rule

3. Cursor rules have the following structure:

---
description: Short description of the rule's purpose
globs: optional/path/pattern/**/*
alwaysApply: false
---
# Rule Title

Main content explaining the rule with markdown formatting.

1. Step-by-step instructions
2. Code examples
3. Guidelines

Example:

When you see a similar pattern:
```go
func Example() string {
  return "1" + "-" + "2"
}
```

Apply the following change:
```go
func Example() string {
  return fmt.Sprintf("%[1]s-%[2]s", "1", "2")
}
```
