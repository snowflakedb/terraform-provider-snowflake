# Rule Improvement Triggers

- New code patterns not covered by existing rules
- Repeated similar implementations across files
- Common error patterns that could be prevented
- New libraries or tools being used consistently
- Emerging best practices in the codebase
- Code changes in particular places, trigger other actions (e.g. documentation or examples updates)

# Analysis Process

- Compare new code with existing rules
- Identify patterns that should be standardized
- Look for references to internal and external documentation
- Check for consistent error handling patterns
- Monitor test patterns and coverage

# Rule Updates

- **Add New Rules When**
  - A new technology/pattern is used in 3+ files
  - Common bugs could be prevented by a rule
  - Developer repeatedly mentions the same feedback to the proposed Agent actions
  - New security or performance patterns emerge

- **Modify Existing Rules When**
  - Better examples exist in the codebase
  - Additional edge cases are discovered
  - Related rules have been updated
  - Implementation details have changed

- **Rule Quality Checks**
  - Rules should be actionable and specific
  - Examples should come from actual code
  - References should be up to date
  - Patterns should be consistently enforced

## Continuous Improvement

- Track common questions or suggestions during development with Agent
- Update rules after major refactors
- Add links to relevant documentation
- Cross-reference related rules

## Rule Deprecation

- Mark outdated patterns as deprecated
- Remove rules that no longer apply
- Update references to deprecated rules
- Document migration paths for old patterns

## Documentation Updates

- Keep examples synchronized with code
- Maintain links between documents
- Document breaking changes

In case of any changes, follow [cursor-rules.mdc](./cursor-rules.mdc) for proper rule formatting and structure
