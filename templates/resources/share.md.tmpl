!> **Caution: Preview Feature** This feature is considered a preview feature in the provider, regardless of the state of the resource in Snowflake. We do not guarantee its stability. It will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add the relevant feature name to `preview_features_enabled` field in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#schema). Please always refer to the [Getting Help](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-help) section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions.

-> **Note** When adding or updating accounts in the `accounts` field, the provider creates a temporary database as a workaround for a Snowflake race condition. This is because accounts cannot be added to a share until after a database has been granted to the share, but database grants depend on the share existing first.
The provider automatically:
1. Creates a temporary database (named `TEMP_<share_name>_<timestamp>`)
2. Grants `USAGE` and `REFERENCE_USAGE` privileges on the temporary database to the share
3. Adds the specified accounts to the share
4. Revokes the privileges and drops the temporary database
This process is fully automated during the creation.

## Example Usage

-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->

-> **Note** If a field has a default value, it is shown next to the type in the schema.
