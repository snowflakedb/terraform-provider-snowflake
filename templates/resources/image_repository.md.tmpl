!> **Caution: Preview Feature** This feature is considered a preview feature in the provider, regardless of the state of the resource in Snowflake. We do not guarantee its stability. It will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add the relevant feature name to `preview_features_enabled` field in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#schema). Please always refer to the [Getting Help](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-help) section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions.

-> **Note** Quoted names for special characters or case-sensitive names are not supported. The same constraint also applies to database and schema names where you create an image repository. That is, database and schema names without quotes are valid when creating an image repository. This limitation in the provider follows the limitation in Snowflake (see [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-image-repository)). Please use only characters compatible with [unquoted identifiers](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/identifiers-syntax#label-unquoted-identifier).

# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

{{ if .HasExample -}}
## Example Usage

-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->

{{ tffile .ExampleFile }}

{{- end }}

-> **Note** If a field has a default value, it is shown next to the type in the schema.

{{ codefile "shell" (printf "examples/resources/%s/import.sh" .Name)}}
{{- end }}
