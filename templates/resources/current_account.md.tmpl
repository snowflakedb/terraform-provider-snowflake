!> **Caution: Preview Feature** This feature is considered a preview feature in the provider, regardless of the state of the resource in Snowflake. We do not guarantee its stability. It will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add the relevant feature name to `preview_features_enabled` field in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#schema). Please always refer to the [Getting Help](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-help) section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions.

!> **Warning** During create operation every parameter that is not set in the resource will be unset on the account.

!> **Warning** This resource requires warehouse to be in the context. To use this resource, specify a default warehouse in the provider configuration or on the user used in the configuration.

!> **Warning** This resource shouldn't be used with `snowflake_current_organization_account`, `snowflake_object_parameter` (with `on_account` field set), and `snowflake_account_parameter` resources in the same configuration, as it may lead to unexpected behavior. Unless they're used to manage the following parameters that are not supported by `snowflake_current_account`: ENABLE_CONSOLE_OUTPUT, ENABLE_PERSONAL_DATABASE, PREVENT_LOAD_FROM_INLINE_URL. They are not supported, because they are not in the [official parameters documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters). Once they are publicly documented, they will be added to the `snowflake_current_account` resource.

!> **Warning** This resource shouldn't be also used with `snowflake_account_password_policy_attachment`, `snowflake_network_policy_attachment`, `snowflake_account_authentication_policy_attachment` resources in the same configuration to manage policies on the current account, as it may lead to unexpected behavior.

-> **Note** On removal, the resource will unset all account properties. To remove the resource without unsetting properties, use [terraform state rm](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/state/rm) command.

-> **Note** You can manage only one such resource **per account**. More instances on one account could cause unexpected behavior.

-> **Note** Currently, this resource does not support organization user group management.

## Example Usage

-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->

-> **Note** If a field has a default value, it is shown next to the type in the schema.
