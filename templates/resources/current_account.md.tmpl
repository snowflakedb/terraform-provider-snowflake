!> **Warning** This resource requires warehouse to be in the context. To use this resource, specify a default warehouse in the provider configuration.

!> **Warning** This resource shouldn't be used with `snowflake_object_parameter` (with `on_account` field set) and `snowflake_account_parameter` resources in the same configuration, as it may lead to unexpected behavior. Unless they're used to manage the following parameters that are not supported by `snowflake_current_account`: ENABLE_CONSOLE_OUTPUT, ENABLE_PERSONAL_DATABASE, PREVENT_LOAD_FROM_INLINE_URL. They are not supported, because they are not in the [official parameters documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters). Once they are publicly documented, they will be added to the `snowflake_current_account` resource.

!> **Warning** This resource shouldn't be also used with `snowflake_account_password_policy_attachment`, `snowflake_network_policy_attachment`, `snowflake_account_authentication_policy_attachment` resources in the same configuration to manage policies on the current account, as it may lead to unexpected behavior.

-> **Note** On removal, the resource will unset all account properties. To remove the resource without unsetting properties, use [terraform state rm](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/state/rm) command.

-> **Note** You can manage only one such resource **per account**. More instances on one account could cause unexpected behavior.

-> **Note** Currently, this resource does not support organization user group management.

## Example Usage

-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->

-> **Note** If a field has a default value, it is shown next to the type in the schema.
