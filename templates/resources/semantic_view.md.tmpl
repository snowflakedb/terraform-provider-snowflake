!> **Caution: Preview Feature** This feature is considered a preview feature in the provider, regardless of the state of the resource in Snowflake. We do not guarantee its stability. It will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add the relevant feature name to `preview_features_enabled` field in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#schema). Please always refer to the [Getting Help](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-help) section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions.

!> **Case-sensitive names** Object names, column names, and aliases are case-sensitive. The provider would wrap them in double quotes when running SQL on Snowflake. Keep it in mind when defining the semantic view (check the [example usage](#example-usage)).

-> **Note** The [`ALTER SEMANTIC VIEW`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-semantic-view) does not currently handle changes to `dimensions`, `facts`, `metrics`, `relationships`, and `tables`. It means that all changes to these attributes will be handled as destroy and recreate.

-> **Note** External changes for `dimensions`, `facts`, `metrics`, `relationships`, and `tables` are not currently handled. Support for this functionality will be added in the next versions of the provider before moving this resource out of preview.

-> **Note** `PRIVATE`/`PUBLIC` qualifiers for semantic expressions are not currently supported. They are treated as `PUBLIC` by default. Support for this functionality will be added in the next versions of the provider before moving this resource out of preview.

-> **Note** Excluding dimensions in `window_function:over_clause:partition_by` clause is not currently supported. Support for this functionality will be added in the next versions of the provider before moving this resource out of preview.

-> **Note** The `window_function:over_clause:order_by` clause must be a complete SQL expression, including any `[ ASC | DESC ] [ NULLS { FIRST | LAST } ]` modifiers. It will be broken down in the next versions of the provider before moving this resource out of preview.

-> **Note** `COPY GRANTS` and `OR REPLACE` are not currently supported.

-> **Note** Output from the [`DESCRIBE SEMANTIC VIEW`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/desc-semantic-view) is not currently available.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile .ExampleFile }}
-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->

-> **Note** If a field has a default value, it is shown next to the type in the schema.
