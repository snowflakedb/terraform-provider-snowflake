!> **Caution: Preview Feature** This feature is considered a preview feature in the provider, regardless of the state of the resource in Snowflake. We do not guarantee its stability. It will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add the relevant feature name to `preview_features_enabled` field in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#schema). Please always refer to the [Getting Help](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-help) section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions.

-> **Note** Identifiers with special or lower-case characters are not supported. This limitation in the provider follows the limitation in Snowflake (see [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-compute-pool)).

-> **Note** Managing compute pool state is limited. It is handled by `initially_suspended`, `auto_suspend_secs`, and `auto_resume` fields. The provider does not support managing the state of compute pools in Snowflake with `ALTER ... SUSPEND` and `ALTER ... RESUME`. See [Compute pool lifecycle documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-compute-pool#compute-pool-lifecycle) for more details.

## Example Usage

-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->

-> **Note** If a field has a default value, it is shown next to the type in the schema.
