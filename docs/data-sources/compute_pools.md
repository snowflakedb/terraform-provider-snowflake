!> **Caution: Preview Feature** This feature is considered a preview feature in the provider, regardless of the state of the resource in Snowflake. We do not guarantee its stability. It will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add the relevant feature name to `preview_features_enabled` field in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#schema). Please always refer to the [Getting Help](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-help) section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions.

# snowflake_compute_pools (Data Source)

Data source used to get details of filtered compute pools. Filtering is aligned with the current possibilities for [SHOW COMPUTE POOLS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-compute-pools) query. The results of SHOW and DESCRIBE are encapsulated in one output collection `compute_pools`.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Simple usage
data "snowflake_compute_pools" "simple" {
}

output "simple_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_compute_pools.simple.compute_pools
}

# Filtering (like)
data "snowflake_compute_pools" "like" {
  like = "compute-pool-name"
}

output "like_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_compute_pools.like.compute_pools
}

# Filtering by prefix (like)
data "snowflake_compute_pools" "like_prefix" {
  like = "prefix%"
}

output "like_prefix_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_compute_pools.like_prefix.compute_pools
}

# Filtering (starts_with)
data "snowflake_compute_pools" "starts_with" {
  starts_with = "prefix-"
}

output "starts_with_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_compute_pools.starts_with.compute_pools
}

# Filtering (limit)
data "snowflake_compute_pools" "limit" {
  limit {
    rows = 10
    from = "prefix-"
  }
}

output "limit_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_compute_pools.limit.compute_pools
}

# Without additional data (to limit the number of calls make for every found compute pool)
data "snowflake_compute_pools" "only_show" {
  # with_describe is turned on by default and it calls DESCRIBE COMPUTE POOL for every compute pool found and attaches its output to compute_pools.*.describe_output field
  with_describe = false
}

output "only_show_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_compute_pools.only_show.compute_pools
}

# Ensure the number of compute pools is equal to at least one element (with the use of postcondition)
data "snowflake_compute_pools" "assert_with_postcondition" {
  like = "compute-pool-name%"
  lifecycle {
    postcondition {
      condition     = length(self.compute_pools) > 0
      error_message = "there should be at least one compute pool"
    }
  }
}

# Ensure the number of compute pools is equal to exactly one element (with the use of check block)
check "compute_pool_check" {
  data "snowflake_compute_pools" "assert_with_check_block" {
    like = "compute-pool-name"
  }

  assert {
    condition     = length(data.snowflake_compute_pools.assert_with_check_block.compute_pools) == 1
    error_message = "compute pools filtered by '${data.snowflake_compute_pools.assert_with_check_block.like}' returned ${length(data.snowflake_compute_pools.assert_with_check_block.compute_pools)} compute pools where one was expected"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `like` (String) Filters the output with **case-insensitive** pattern, with support for SQL wildcard characters (`%` and `_`).
- `limit` (Block List, Max: 1) Limits the number of rows returned. If the `limit.from` is set, then the limit will start from the first element matched by the expression. The expression is only used to match with the first element, later on the elements are not matched by the prefix, but you can enforce a certain pattern with `starts_with` or `like`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--limit))
- `starts_with` (String) Filters the output with **case-sensitive** characters indicating the beginning of the object name.
- `with_describe` (Boolean) (Default: `true`) Runs DESC COMPUTE POOL for each compute pool returned by SHOW COMPUTE POOLS. The output of describe is saved to the description field. By default this value is set to true.

### Read-Only

- `compute_pools` (List of Object) Holds the aggregated output of all compute pools details queries. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--compute_pools))
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--limit"></a>
### Nested Schema for `limit`

Required:

- `rows` (Number) The maximum number of rows to return.

Optional:

- `from` (String) Specifies a **case-sensitive** pattern that is used to match object name. After the first match, the limit on the number of rows will be applied.
