!> **Caution: Preview Feature** This feature is considered a preview feature in the provider, regardless of the state of the resource in Snowflake. We do not guarantee its stability. It will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add the relevant feature name to `preview_features_enabled` field in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#schema). Please always refer to the [Getting Help](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-help) section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions.

# snowflake_user_programmatic_access_tokens (Data Source)

Data source used to get details of filtered user programmatic access tokens. Filtering is aligned with the current possibilities for [SHOW USER PROGRAMMATIC ACCESS TOKENS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-user-programmatic-access-tokens) query. The results of SHOW are encapsulated in one output collection `user_programmatic_access_tokens`.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Simple usage
data "snowflake_user_programmatic_access_tokens" "simple" {
  for_user = "<user_name>"
}

output "simple_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_user_programmatic_access_tokens.simple.user_programmatic_access_tokens
}

# Ensure the number of user programmatic access tokens is equal to at least one element (with the use of postcondition)
data "snowflake_user_programmatic_access_tokens" "assert_with_postcondition" {
  for_user = "<user_name>"
  lifecycle {
    postcondition {
      condition     = length(self.user_programmatic_access_tokens) > 0
      error_message = "there should be at least one user programmatic access token"
    }
  }
}

# Ensure the number of user programmatic access tokens is equal to exactly one element (with the use of check block)
check "user_programmatic_access_token_check" {
  data "snowflake_user_programmatic_access_tokens" "assert_with_check_block" {
    for_user = "<user_name>"
  }

  assert {
    condition     = length(data.snowflake_user_programmatic_access_tokens.assert_with_check_block.user_programmatic_access_tokens) == 1
    error_message = "user programmatic access tokens filtered by '${data.snowflake_user_programmatic_access_tokens.assert_with_check_block.for_user}' returned ${length(data.snowflake_user_programmatic_access_tokens.assert_with_check_block.user_programmatic_access_tokens)} user programmatic access tokens where one was expected"
  }
}
```
