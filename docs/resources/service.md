subcategory: "Preview"
description: |-
  Resource used to manage services. For more information, check services documentation https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-service. A long-running service is like a web service that does not end automatically. After you create a service, Snowflake manages the running service. For example, if a service container stops, for whatever reason, Snowflake restarts that container so the service runs uninterrupted. See Working with services https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-services developer guide for more details.

!> **Caution: Preview Feature** This feature is considered a preview feature in the provider, regardless of the state of the resource in Snowflake. We do not guarantee its stability. It will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add the relevant feature name to `preview_features_enabled` field in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#schema). Please always refer to the [Getting Help](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-help) section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions.

-> **Note** Managing services via specification templates is not yet supported. This will be addressed in the next versions.

-> **Note** Managing service state is limited. It is handled by `auto_suspend_secs`, and `auto_resume` fields. The provider does not support managing the state of services in Snowflake with `ALTER ... SUSPEND` and `ALTER ... RESUME`. See [Suspending a service documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-services#suspending-a-service) for more details.

# snowflake_service (Resource)

Resource used to manage services. For more information, check [services documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-service). A long-running service is like a web service that does not end automatically. After you create a service, Snowflake manages the running service. For example, if a service container stops, for whatever reason, Snowflake restarts that container so the service runs uninterrupted. See [Working with services](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-services) developer guide for more details.

## Example Usage

-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->

```terraform
# basic resource - from specification file on stage
resource "snowflake_service" "basic" {
  database        = snowflake_database.test.name
  schema          = snowflake_schema.test.name
  name            = "SERVICE"
  in_compute_pool = snowflake_compute_pool.test.name
  from_specification {
    stage = snowflake_stage.basic.fully_qualified_name
    file  = "spec.yaml"
  }
}

# basic resource - from specification content
resource "snowflake_service" "basic" {
  database        = snowflake_database.test.name
  schema          = snowflake_schema.test.name
  name            = "SERVICE"
  in_compute_pool = snowflake_compute_pool.test.name
  from_specification {
    text = <<-EOT
spec:

    image: /database/schema/image_repository/exampleimage:latest
    EOT
  }
}

# complete resource
resource "snowflake_compute_pool" "complete" {
  database        = snowflake_database.test.name
  schema          = snowflake_schema.test.name
  name            = "SERVICE"
  in_compute_pool = snowflake_compute_pool.test.name
  from_specification {
    stage = snowflake_stage.complete.fully_qualified_name
    # or, with explicit stage value
    # stage = "\"DATABASE\".\"SCHEMA\".\"STAGE\""
    path = "path/to/spec"
    file = "spec.yaml"
  }
  auto_suspend_secs = 1200
  external_access_integrations = [
    "INTEGRATION"
  ]
  auto_resume         = true
  min_instances       = 1
  min_ready_instances = 1
  max_instances       = 2
  query_warehouse     = snowflake_warehouse.test.name
  comment             = "A service."
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `compute_pool` (String) Specifies the name of the compute pool in your account on which to run the service. Identifiers with special or lower-case characters are not supported. This limitation in the provider follows the limitation in Snowflake (see [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-compute-pool)). Due to technical limitations (read more [here](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#known-limitations-and-identifier-recommendations)), avoid using the following characters: `|`, `.`, `"`.
- `database` (String) The database in which to create the service. Due to technical limitations (read more [here](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#known-limitations-and-identifier-recommendations)), avoid using the following characters: `|`, `.`, `"`.
- `name` (String) Specifies the identifier for the service; must be unique for the schema in which the service is created. Due to technical limitations (read more [here](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#known-limitations-and-identifier-recommendations)), avoid using the following characters: `|`, `.`, `"`.
- `schema` (String) The schema in which to create the service. Due to technical limitations (read more [here](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#known-limitations-and-identifier-recommendations)), avoid using the following characters: `|`, `.`, `"`.

### Optional

- `auto_resume` (String) (Default: fallback to Snowflake default - uses special value that cannot be set in the configuration manually (`default`)) Specifies whether to automatically resume a service. Available options are: "true" or "false". When the value is not set in the configuration the provider will put "default" there which means to use the Snowflake default for this value.
- `auto_suspend_secs` (Number) (Default: fallback to Snowflake default - uses special value that cannot be set in the configuration manually (`-1`)) Specifies the number of seconds of inactivity (service is idle) after which Snowflake automatically suspends the service.
- `comment` (String) Specifies a comment for the service.
- `external_access_integrations` (Set of String) Specifies the names of the external access integrations that allow your service to access external sites.
- `from_specification` (Block List, Max: 1) Specifies the service specification to use for the service. Note that external changes on this field and nested fields are not detected. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--from_specification))
- `max_instances` (Number) Specifies the maximum number of service instances to run.
- `min_instances` (Number) Specifies the minimum number of service instances to run.
- `min_ready_instances` (Number) Indicates the minimum service instances that must be ready for Snowflake to consider the service is ready to process requests.
- `query_warehouse` (String) Warehouse to use if a service container connects to Snowflake to execute a query but does not explicitly specify a warehouse to use. Due to technical limitations (read more [here](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#known-limitations-and-identifier-recommendations)), avoid using the following characters: `|`, `.`, `"`.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `describe_output` (List of Object) Outputs the result of `DESCRIBE SERVICE` for the given service. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--describe_output))
- `fully_qualified_name` (String) Fully qualified name of the resource. For more information, see [object name resolution](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/name-resolution).
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `service_type` (String) Specifies a type for the service. This field is used for checking external changes and recreating the resources if needed.
- `show_output` (List of Object) Outputs the result of `SHOW SERVICES` for the given service. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--show_output))

<a id="nestedblock--from_specification"></a>
### Nested Schema for `from_specification`

Optional:

- `file` (String) The file name of the service specification.
- `path` (String) The path to the service specification file on the given stage. When the path is specified, the `/` character is automatically added as a path prefix. Example: `path/to/spec`.
- `stage` (String) The fully qualified name of the stage containing the service specification file. At symbol (`@`) is added automatically.
- `text` (String) The embedded text of the service specification.
