subcategory: "Preview"
description: |-
  Resource used to manage job services. For more information, check services documentation https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/execute-job-service. Executes a Snowpark Container Services service as a job. A service, created using CREATE SERVICE, is long-running and you must explicitly stop it when it is no longer needed. On the other hand, a job, created using EXECUTE JOB SERVICE (with ASYNC=TRUE in this resource), returns immediately while the job is running. See Working with services https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-services developer guide for more details.

!> **Caution: Preview Feature** This feature is considered a preview feature in the provider, regardless of the state of the resource in Snowflake. We do not guarantee its stability. It will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add the relevant feature name to `preview_features_enabled` field in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#schema). Please always refer to the [Getting Help](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-help) section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions.

<!-- TODO(SNOW-2129584): address this limitation -->
!> **Caution** Only asynchronous job services are supported. This resource uses `ASYNC=TRUE` during creation. In this case, the command returns immediately while the job is running. Creating a job service automatically executes the job (read more in [EXECUTE JOB SERVICE docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/execute-job-service)).

-> **Note** For asynchronous jobs, Snowflake does not perform automatic cleanup after completion. You must either remove the resource or execute the `DROP SERVICE` command to remove the job. If you want to execute the job again, use the [replace flag](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/apply#replace-resource).

-> **Note** Managing services via specification templates is not yet supported. This will be addressed in the next versions.

# snowflake_job_service (Resource)

Resource used to manage job services. For more information, check [services documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/execute-job-service). Executes a Snowpark Container Services service as a job. A service, created using `CREATE SERVICE`, is long-running and you must explicitly stop it when it is no longer needed. On the other hand, a job, created using EXECUTE JOB SERVICE (with `ASYNC=TRUE` in this resource), returns immediately while the job is running. See [Working with services](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-services) developer guide for more details.

## Example Usage

-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->

```terraform
# basic resource - from specification file on stage
resource "snowflake_job_service" "basic" {
  database        = snowflake_database.test.name
  schema          = snowflake_schema.test.name
  name            = "SERVICE"
  in_compute_pool = snowflake_compute_pool.test.name
  from_specification {
    stage = snowflake_stage.test.fully_qualified_name
    file  = "spec.yaml"
  }
}

# basic resource - from specification content
resource "snowflake_job_service" "basic" {
  database        = snowflake_database.test.name
  schema          = snowflake_schema.test.name
  name            = "SERVICE"
  in_compute_pool = snowflake_compute_pool.test.name
  from_specification {
    text = <<-EOT
spec:
  containers:
  - name: example-container
    image: /database/schema/image_repository/exampleimage:latest
    EOT
  }
}

# complete resource
resource "snowflake_job_service" "complete" {
  database        = snowflake_database.test.name
  schema          = snowflake_schema.test.name
  name            = "SERVICE"
  in_compute_pool = snowflake_compute_pool.test.name
  from_specification {
    stage = snowflake_stage.test.fully_qualified_name
    # or, with explicit stage value
    # stage = "\"DATABASE\".\"SCHEMA\".\"STAGE\""
    path = "path/to/spec"
    file = "spec.yaml"
  }
  external_access_integrations = [
    "INTEGRATION"
  ]
  async           = true
  query_warehouse = "WAREHOUSE"
  comment         = "A service."
}
```

-> **Note** If a field has a default value, it is shown next to the type in the schema.

## Schema

### Required

- `compute_pool` (String) Specifies the name of the compute pool in your account on which to run the service. Identifiers with special or lower-case characters are not supported. This limitation in the provider follows the limitation in Snowflake (see [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-compute-pool)). Due to technical limitations (read more [here](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#known-limitations-and-identifier-recommendations)), avoid using the following characters: `|`, `.`, `"`.
- `database` (String) The database in which to create the service. Due to technical limitations (read more [here](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#known-limitations-and-identifier-recommendations)), avoid using the following characters: `|`, `.`, `"`.
- `name` (String) Specifies the identifier for the service; must be unique for the schema in which the service is created. Due to technical limitations (read more [here](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#known-limitations-and-identifier-recommendations)), avoid using the following characters: `|`, `.`, `"`.
- `schema` (String) The schema in which to create the service. Due to technical limitations (read more [here](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#known-limitations-and-identifier-recommendations)), avoid using the following characters: `|`, `.`, `"`.

### Optional

- `comment` (String) Specifies a comment for the service.
- `external_access_integrations` (Set of String) Specifies the names of the external access integrations that allow your service to access external sites.
- `from_specification` (Block List, Max: 1) Specifies the service specification to use for the service. Note that external changes on this field and nested fields are not detected. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--from_specification))
- `query_warehouse` (String) Warehouse to use if a service container connects to Snowflake to execute a query but does not explicitly specify a warehouse to use. Due to technical limitations (read more [here](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#known-limitations-and-identifier-recommendations)), avoid using the following characters: `|`, `.`, `"`.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
