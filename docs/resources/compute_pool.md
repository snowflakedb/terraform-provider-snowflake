  Resource used to manage compute pools. For more information, check compute pools documentation https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-compute-pool. A compute pool is a collection of one or more virtual machine (VM) nodes on which Snowflake runs your Snowpark Container Services services (including job services). See Working with compute pools https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-compute-pool developer guide for more details.

-> **Note** Identifiers with special or lower-case characters are not supported. This limitation in the provider follows the limitation in Snowflake (see [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-compute-pool)).

-> **Note** Managing compute pool state is limited. It is handled by `initially_suspended`, `auto_suspend_secs`, and `auto_resume` fields. The provider does not support managing the state of compute pools in Snowflake with `ALTER ... SUSPEND` and `ALTER ... RESUME`. See [Compute pool lifecycle documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-compute-pool#compute-pool-lifecycle) for more details.

# snowflake_compute_pool (Resource)

Resource used to manage compute pools. For more information, check [compute pools documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-compute-pool). A compute pool is a collection of one or more virtual machine (VM) nodes on which Snowflake runs your Snowpark Container Services services (including job services). See [Working with compute pools](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-compute-pool) developer guide for more details.

## Example Usage

-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->

```terraform
# basic resource
resource "snowflake_compute_pool" "basic" {
  name            = "COMPUTE_POOL"
  min_nodes       = 1
  max_nodes       = 2
  instance_family = "CPU_X64_S"
}

# complete resource
resource "snowflake_compute_pool" "complete" {
  name                = "COMPUTE_POOL"
  for_application     = "APPLICATION_NAME"
  min_nodes           = 1
  max_nodes           = 2
  instance_family     = "CPU_X64_S"
  auto_resume         = "true"
  initially_suspended = "true"
  auto_suspend_secs   = 1200
  comment             = "A compute pool."
}
```

-> **Note** If a field has a default value, it is shown next to the type in the schema.

## Schema

### Required

- `instance_family` (String) Identifies the type of machine you want to provision for the nodes in the compute pool. Valid values are (case-insensitive): `CPU_X64_XS` | `CPU_X64_S` | `CPU_X64_M` | `CPU_X64_SL` | `CPU_X64_L` | `HIGHMEM_X64_S` | `HIGHMEM_X64_M` | `HIGHMEM_X64_L` | `HIGHMEM_X64_SL` | `GPU_NV_S` | `GPU_NV_M` | `GPU_NV_L` | `GPU_NV_XS` | `GPU_NV_SM` | `GPU_NV_2M` | `GPU_NV_3M` | `GPU_NV_SL` | `GPU_GCP_NV_L4_1_24G` | `GPU_GCP_NV_L4_4_24G` | `GPU_GCP_NV_A100_8_40G`. Not all instance families are supported in all regions. Run `SHOW COMPUTE POOL INSTANCE FAMILIES` to see the list of supported instance families in your region.
- `max_nodes` (Number) Specifies the maximum number of nodes for the compute pool.
- `min_nodes` (Number) Specifies the minimum number of nodes for the compute pool.
- `name` (String) Specifies the identifier for the compute pool; must be unique for the account. Due to technical limitations (read more [here](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#known-limitations-and-identifier-recommendations)), avoid using the following characters: `|`, `.`, `"`.

### Optional

- `auto_resume` (String) (Default: fallback to Snowflake default - uses special value that cannot be set in the configuration manually (`default`)) Specifies whether to automatically resume a compute pool when a service or job is submitted to it. Available options are: "true" or "false". When the value is not set in the configuration the provider will put "default" there which means to use the Snowflake default for this value.
- `auto_suspend_secs` (Number) (Default: fallback to Snowflake default - uses special value that cannot be set in the configuration manually (`-1`)) Number of seconds of inactivity after which you want Snowflake to automatically suspend the compute pool.
- `comment` (String) Specifies a comment for the compute pool.
- `for_application` (String) Specifies the Snowflake Native App name.
- `initially_suspended` (String) (Default: fallback to Snowflake default - uses special value that cannot be set in the configuration manually (`default`)) Specifies whether the compute pool is created initially in the suspended state. This field is used only when creating a compute pool. Changes on this field are ignored after creation.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `describe_output` (List of Object) Outputs the result of `DESCRIBE COMPUTE POOL` for the given compute pool. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--describe_output))
- `fully_qualified_name` (String) Fully qualified name of the resource. For more information, see [object name resolution](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/name-resolution).
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `show_output` (List of Object) Outputs the result of `SHOW COMPUTE POOLS` for the given compute pool. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--show_output))
